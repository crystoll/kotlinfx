Study Notes on Kotlin + JavaFX

- Kotlin + JavaFX like numeric values as doubles instead of int
- Kotlin main method is different: Behaves as companion object like in Scala
- GraphicsContext is key to everything to do with draw: fill, stroke, width, colors, etc
- Kotlin has nice shortcuts to properties without having to use get/setxxx always
- Kotlin instantiation happens without new-keyword
